## Instructions
All the algorithms were written in C++. While the code can run using an IDE that can read and compile C++, we recommend running the programs in VSCode as using an online compiler may lead to unexpected errors. If you have any problems trying to compile this in VSCode, please use the 'Developer Command Prompt for VS' to open the program in VSCode. Using the command prompt, navigate to the folder holding the code then execute the following command:
    
    code .

This should allow you to run and compile each program.
